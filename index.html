    <p><b>Notes From What I Learned - Stage 0</b></p>

<p><b>Unit 1 - The Basics of the Web</b></p>

<p><b>The World Wide Web</b></p>

<p>HTML is the main type of document on the web. Plain text, images, videos and
  <br> music are some types of files that can be found on the web.</p>

<p><b>Major Pieces of the Web</b></p>

<p>Major pieces of the web include the user, the computer with the internet
  <br> browser (such as Firefox, Chrome, etc.), the internet, and servers. Requests
  <br> are made using HTTP protocol to grab files from servers and send them to the
  <br> user's browser.</p>

<p><b>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</b></p>

<p>HTML has HTML markups. Markups usually consist of an opening tag, contents,
  <br> and a closing tag but there are exceptions. Tags without closing tags are void tags.
  <br> This structure of an opening tag, contents, and closing tag is called an element.
</p>

<p>The bold tag makes text appear <b>bold</b>. The emphasis tag makes tag into
  <br>
  <em>italics</em>. They can be used in combinations to make text <em><b>both<br>
bold and in italics.</b></em> Not closing these two tags will affect all text
  <br> after that tag, causing unwanted font changes, so it's important to check that
  <br> tags have been closed.</p>

<p>Tags can also create HTML links. An example of this is <a href="www.google.coM">Google</a>.
  <br> This is done using the anchor tag with the href attribute.</p>

<p>The image tag has no closing tag because it contains no content. It contains
  <br> a src to show where the image is located. Below is an examle of such a tag:
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png" alt="GoogleLogo">
  <br>
</p>

<p>The br tag is the line break tag. This one has no closing tag. I've been
  <br> using it here to end sentences. It is useful for creating whitespace to make
  <br> text more presentable. The p tag is for creating paragraphs. It comes very handy
  <br> in keeping my text organized. Unlike the br tag, the p tag has a closing tag. Like
  <br> the br tag, the p tag causes a like break.</p>

<p>The br tag is an inline element. The p tag is a block element. Inline affects the
  <br> contents inline. Block elements actually create a invisible box surrounding the
  <br> element. This box actually has height and width. The tag span is inline and div
  <br> is block. They are used for styling.</p>

<p>HTML documents have tags used to organize its contents. This includes the head,
  <br> title, and body.</p>
